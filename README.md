# cards_test

A card battler test to test out state machines and state in python

## How does this work?

When launching the game, you will be in the main menu. You can view your hand from there, you can attack and change the music volume with a slider and exit. The goal of this test is to ensure that your player card is not killed. You need to kill the oponent's player card before... she does. You can do so via the menues.

## How to run?

In order to run, make sure you have pygame, sound_lib and cytolk installed and just run python game.py
